# Tutorials

A good intro to start with is reading the My first FPGA document to get familiar with Quartus. DE10 version is a more up to date document with latest Quartus versions but have a look at the Sockit one for specific things like device selection and Pins location.

Note: for device selection check the number on your Cyclone V chip (my board comes with device 5CSXFC6D6F31C6) but it will work also if you use device 5CSXFC6D6F31C8.

Check folders above which contain different tutorials.

Learn an HDL (hardware description language) like Verilog or VHDL. 

Most of the tutorials wrote for the [Chameleon96](https://github.com/SoCFPGA-learning/Chameleon96) board will be of help and can be adapted easily for the SoCKit as well. Main difference is that with SoCKit board you don't have to mess with Platform Designer and LoanIO's from the beginning, so it's an easier board to start with.
