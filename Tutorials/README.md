# Tutorials

A good intro to start with is reading the [My first FPGA](./../Documents/My_First_Fpga.pdf) document to get familiar with Quartus.

Check folders which contain different tutorials.

Most of the tutorials wrote for the [Chameleon96](https://github.com/SoCFPGA-learning/Chameleon96) board will be of help and can be adapted easily for the SoCKit as well. Main difference is that with SoCKit board you don't have to mess with the HPS and LoanIO's from the beginning, so it's an easier board to start with.
